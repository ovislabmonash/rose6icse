# Recognizing Developers’ Emotions while Programming: Replication Package



This package contains all the material used for the analysis presented in the paper #275 "Recognizing Developers’ Emotions while Programming" accepted at the main track of ICSE 2020.  

The scripts in the package can be used replicate the analysis described in the paper. In particular, the scripts can be used to:

- plot emotion ratings on the Russell Circumplex Model,
- create a linear mixed model to investigate the correlation between self-perceived emotions and self-perceived progress,
- extract features from data collected using the Brainlink headset and the Empatica E4 wristband,
- train the classification models for emotional arousal and valence and compute the classification performance, using both validation settings described in the paper (i.e., Hold-out test est and Leave-one-subject-out)

The script for extracting the features also leverages external libraries for preprocessing the raw signals acquired from the biometric sensor, as acknowledged in the paper.
