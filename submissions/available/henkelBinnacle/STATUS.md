# Reusable and Available

We would like to apply for the `Reusable` and `Available` badges:

1. We have made our artifact available on GitHub and placed a GitHub release on Zenodo to obtain a DOI (`10.5281/zenodo.3628771`)

2. We have provided both the dependencies for running our tools (via Docker) and documentation (in this repository)

3. We have setup the artifact to run our full experiments (minus the original data collection) and to produce results in the same format as those given in our paper (where feasible---Research Question 2 involves qualitiative analysis that cannot be automatically generated)

4. We have include all of our data, in all of its key representations, and the tools we built to transform this data, to allow others to jump-start their own work in this area
