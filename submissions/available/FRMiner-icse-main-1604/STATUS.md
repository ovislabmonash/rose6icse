## We are applying for the Available badge, because:
1. Our artifact is available via https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/https://github.com/FRMiner/FRMiner/directory/
2. We have a clear and well-organised code structure, which is easy to read.
3. We release and preprocess the data we annotated in the data folder.
