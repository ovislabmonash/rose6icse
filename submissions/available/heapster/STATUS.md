## Reusable and Available Badges Description

We are applying for the Reusable and Available Badges for the following reasons:

- We provide public access to our tool _Heapster_ and all supportive scripts/toolings to replicate but also reproduce our experiments

- We provide public access to all the experimental input and output data as described in our paper and present a guideline to replicate these results 

- We provide public access to the _DroidMacroBench_ benchmarking suite, containing 12 of the 200 most downloaded closed-source real-world Android applications from Google Playstore and a labeled set of taint-analysis findings produced by the FlowDroid analyzer. We thereby allow and hope for further taint-analysis experiments on real-world applications with or without the use of heap-snapshots. 

- We describe in detail how to use the tooling to build upon our experiments or to run custom experiments

- We provide the source code of our toolings and allow for extension so that future research can build upon our toolings and experiments
