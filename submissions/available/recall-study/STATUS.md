## Status

We apply for the **Reusable** and **Available** Badges.

The artifact is designed to support replication of results obtained from the experiments presented in the companion [paper](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/foswiki/pub/Main/JensDietrich/recall.pdf). It has the scripts (including sources) and data to conduct the experiments, and to produce the statistics and graphs presented in this paper. The replication steps are explained in detail in the associated repository (See the [README file](https://bitbucket.org/Li_Sui/recall-study-artefact/src/master/README.md)).
