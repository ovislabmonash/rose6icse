# Artifact evaluation for Dogfood

## Overview

Dogfood is a prototype tool to generate workloads and test file systems.
In this artifact,
we introduce its basic usage,
how to use it to reproduce the experiment results in the paper,
and how to reuse it for further file system testing.

## Obtain the artifact

We have upload a docker image containing all necessary files and subjects.
[HERE](https://hub.docker.com/r/midwinter/dogfood)

Dogfood should be used under a Linux operating system.
Ubuntu-16.04 and Ubuntu-18.04 are recommendations as we have tested Dogfood under them.
*Note* that a virtual machine such as virtual-box or vmware may not work because Dogfood leverages the KVM,
which may be unavailable in a virtual environment.

Please follow the instructions in `INSTALL.md` to complete the installation.

## Reproduce results in the paper

Since there are three testing scenarios are presented in the paper,
we introduce steps to reproduce the results, respectively.

### The sequential scenario

#### Reproduce the detected bugs

The tool `tmux` is preferred to open multiple terminals:

```bash
tmux -2 # Start tmux
Ctrl+b c # Start another terminal window
Ctrl+b w # Switch between the windows; learn more from the tmux documentations
```

As shown in the `INSTALL.md`, start QEMU first:

```bash
$qemu: ./ctrl start
```

Create a virtual machine snapshot:

```bash
$test: ./ctrl init
```

Run bug case scripts:

```bash
$test: ./bugcase/<subdirectory>/trigger.sh
```

The status of each bug is listed in the file `workspace/bugcase/buglist.md`

#### Compare with Syzkaller for long-time running

Run dogfood is easy:

```bash
$qemu: ./ctrl start # Start QEMU
$test: ./ctrl init
$test: ./food --fs=<file system> --test
```

After running for 12 hours,
use the `workspace/analyze-log.py` to extract the number of crashes.

The `<file system>` should be one of
(ext4, btrfs, f2fs, reiserfs, jfs, gfs2, ocfs2).

Run Syzkaller need some extra steps:

1. Install Syzkaller, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/contributing.md#go)
2. Create a disk formatted by a file system 
(we provide scripts to make it easy, run):
```bash
cd workspace/objs/debian-image
./create-image.sh
./create-fs-image.sh <file system>
```
Which means:
- Create a Debian Linux Image, [instructions](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/linux/setup_ubuntu-host_qemu-vm_x86-64-kernel.md#image)
- Create a disk formatted by a file system containing the Debian Linux tools

3. Run Syzkaller

We have provided a Syzkaller configuration and a script.

- Specify `workspace/syzkaller/my.cfg` file with two parameters: `$WORKSPACE_DIR`---the absolute path of `workspace/`, and the absolute path where Syzkaller installed.

If Syzkaller is installed according to the above-mentioned instructions successfully, just run:
```bash
./run.sh
```

After running for 12 hours, check the results.

### The crash consistency scenario

[Crashmonkey](https://github.com/utsaslab/crashmonkey) works on specific kernels.
To ease the burden of [setting](https://github.com/utsaslab/crashmonkey#setup),
we provide a VM image, [download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qxIqszkJd-WWtQfHB4taWvLWbM7reCy7/view?usp=sharing),
which is based on Ubuntu-16.04 but with the specific kernel and containing crashmonkey.

```bash
tar -xzvf ubuntu-16.04-clone.qcow2.tar.gz
sudo apt-get install virt-manager
sudo virt-manager
```

Import the VM image (in virt-manager, click):

> File -> New Virtual Machine -> Importing existing disk image -> Forward -> Browse -> Browse Local -> Choose the path of qcow2 file, Choose OS type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu 16.04 -> Forward -> Forward -> Finish

Start up the VM and login via ssh:

```bash
ssh icse20@192.168.122.106
# password: icse
```

If the IP address of the VM is not sure, use the following commands to check it:

```bash
sudo virsh net-list
```

That should display like this:

```
Name     State   Autostart Persistent
---------------------------------------
default  active  yes       yes
```

Then, use the following command to check the IP address.

```bash
sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases default # `default` is the name from the last result
```

Now, we work in the VM under directory `/home/icse20`.

All workloads generate by ACE is located at directory `/home/icse20/crashmonkey/code/tests/generated_workloads`.

All workloads generated by Dogfood is located at directory `/home/icse20/subjects/cmp-cases` and `/home/icse20/subjects/large-cases`.
The former is used to compared with ACE and the latter consists of a great number of workloads (presented in the paper).

Run workloads by ACE:

```bash
cd crashmonkey

sudo python xfsMonkey.py -f /dev/vda -d /dev/cow_ram0 -t <fs> -e 102400 -u build/tests/generated_workloads/ > outfile
```
`<fs>` should be one of (f2fs, ext4, btrfs).

Run workloads by Dogfood:

```bash
cp subjects/cmp-cases/yy-*.cpp dogfood/ # comparison cases
# or
cp subjects/large-cases/zz-*.cpp dogfood/ # large cases

cd crashmonkey
make

sudo python xfsMonkey.py -f /dev/vda -d /dev/cow_ram0 -t <fs> -e 102400 -u build/tests/dogfood/ > outfile
```

Run the command to count #detected issues
```bash
./diff_count.py
```

Note that before each run, clean redundant files by

```bash
./clean.sh
```

You can also use script `dogfood/py-code/b3Food.py` to generate more subjects (generated in direcotry `output/`) and copy these subjects to the directory `dogfood` in the VM.

### The concurrency scenario

We have generate 500 workloads for concurrency testing,
which is located at `workspace/con-subjects` after being extracted.

```bash
tar -xzvf con-subjects.tar.gz
```

Configure `FS` in `run-con-subjects.sh` and execute it:

```bash
./run-con-subjects
```

## Reuse Dogfood: automatic testing

Reuse dogfood to test other file systems.
We can create a fresh workspace to test multiple file systems in parallel.
The script `workspace/bundle` is used.

```bash
TEST_DIR=<A testing directory>
FS=<File system to test>
./bundle $TEST_DIR
```

Now, we can use dogfood as mentioned before.
Start the QEMU and testing.

```bash
cd $TEST_DIR

$qemu: ./ctrl start # start QEMU

$test: cd $TEST_DIR
$test: ./ctrl init
$test: ./food --fs=$FS --test
```

If you do not want to start qemu manually, using

```bash
$test: ./food --fs=$FS --test --qemu
```

This will start QEMU as a daemon thread automatically,
but the logs/outputs are also not displayed in the terminal.
We must check the log `vm.log` to analyze the results.

### Notes for multiple testing in parallel

When testing multiple file systems in parallel,
you should use `bundle` to create testing directories for each file system and edit file `$TEST_DIR/mngr-tools/config.sh`.

You MUST set `TELNET_PORT`, `TCP_PORT`, and `SSH_PORT` differently for each file system testing.

### Analyze the results

```bash
$test: ./analyze-log.py # Count #crashes
$test: ./analyze-log.py | sort | uniq # Count unique bugs
```

## Reuse Dogfood: how to reproduce a new bug

When finding a bug logged in the log file `workspace/vm.log`,
you can make a test case to reproduce it.
The script workspace/bug-extract is used to extract bug cases automatically.
When finding a bug in the log, you can make a test case to reproduce it.
The following steps may help:

### 1. Locate the bug, like

> [  34.786048] kernel BUG at fs/f2fs/data.c:317!

### 2. Check the log from the bug location backward to find the test case name, like

> TEST CASE[ ../workspace/C-output/2019_07_31-20:06:15-cGKYX/2.c with f2fs-0.img ]

This is the C program file to manifest the bug and its disk image.

### 3. Collect all mount options in `MOUNT OPT [*]` between the location of test case name and bug location, like

> MOUNT OPT [ background_gc=off,nouser_xattr,noacl,active_logs=2,inline_data,inline_dentry,extent_cache,noextent_cache,noinline_data,data_flush,mode=lfs,io_bits=3,usrquota,grpquota,quota,noquota,fsync_mode=nobarrier ]

### 4. Copy the C program file and disk image found in step 2 to the directory `template`

### 5. Change the script `template/trigger.sh`

- `DISK_NAME` is the name of disk image with out extension, like `f2fs-0` in our example.
- `CASE_NAME` is the name of C program file, like `2.c` in our example.
- `FS` is the file system to test

### 6. Copy the mount options line by line (the order should be the same as the log file) in the file `template/mountfood`, like

```shell
options=(
"..." # Other options
"background_gc=off,nouser_xattr,noacl,active_logs=2,inline_data,inline_dentry,extent_cache,noextent_cache,noinline_data,data_flush,mode=lfs,io_bits=3,usrquota,grpquota,quota,noquota,fsync_mode=nobarrier"
"..." # Other options
)
```

### 7. Run it as the demo in section Test QEMU

```bash
$test: ./template/trigger.sh
```
