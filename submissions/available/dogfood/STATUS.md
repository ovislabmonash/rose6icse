We apply for the `Reusable and Available` badges.

First, we released our program and artifacts, which are `available` for others.
Consider that testing file systems in kernels needs tedious manual work,
we have built artifacts before-hand and provide scripts to execute them automatically as far as possible
to ease the burden of reproducing results of our experiments.

Second, our tool can be `reused` for further testing.
We describe the workflow and usages of the tool step by step for a comprehensive guideline.

To name a few, some artifacts are easy to reuse:

- The `build` script can be used to help compile other kernels
- The `food` script can be used to testing file systems automatically
- Workloads generated by Dogfood can be reused, i.e. they can be linked with other executor runtime (like examples in `workspace/executor`)

We hope that the tool could be used by others and make contributions to the community.
