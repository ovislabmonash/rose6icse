We are applying for "Reusable" and "Available" badges. All of our experimental data is publicly available online and can be reused by other researchers. However, our study includes a lot of resource-demanding manual activities such as manual labelling of StackOverflow discussions and GitHub commits/issues, open coding of interviews with developers and then building a large taxonomy out of obtained information. Therefore, we do not think that our study can be replicated or reproduced by the artifact evaluation committee, so we do not apply for "Replicated" and "Reproduced" badges.
