# Targeted Badges

This submission targets the _Available_ badge. 
We provide all the crawls used for the analysis as well as the tools and subject applications for researchers to recreate our results. 

The manually labelled [datasets] (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3376729) and [crawls] (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3385376) can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of future research targetting functional near-duplicate detection in web applications. 

A [virtual machine] (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3387759) that replicates the experiment conditions is also provided to help researchers use the tools and subjects.
