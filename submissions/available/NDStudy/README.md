# Near-Duplicate Detection Study

This artifact submission includes all the tools developed and manually labelled data along with subject applications used for the ICSE Technical Track, submission 631: "Near-Duplicate Detection in Web App Model Inference".
 
 Our study aims to understand the limitations of current state-of-the-art in automatically inferring a model for any given web app. As part of the study, we developed 10 crawljax state abstractions for existing near-duplicate detection techniques. Thereafter, we created ground truth models manually for nine subject web apps. These ground truth models were then used as a reference to analyze crawl models created by the ten near-duplicate detection techniques. 
 
 The artifact provides the ground truth models and all the crawls that were analyzed to conduct the study. The data-sets used to compute optimal thresholds for each technique are also provided. 
 
 
The crawljax plugins and tools that were developed to carry out the analysis are also made available. 

In order to enable easy access to the tools, a virtual machine with tools and all the subject apps is also provided.  

The public repository provides all the information needed to setup and use the tools and datasets. hhttps://github.com/NDStudyICSE2019/NDStudy
