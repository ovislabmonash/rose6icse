# Solidity Smart Contract Analyzer

This artifact submission includes a static analyzer for the ICSE Technical Track, "Gap between Theory and Practice : An Empirical Study of Security Patches in Solidity." 

The static analyzer analyzes Solidity smart contracts and identifies eight vulnerabilities discussed in the paper. (shown in Table 1) 
This artifact does not contain a data set used in the paper, such as 55,046 smart contracts due to the license issue.
Instead, we provide a test contract that contains eight vulnerabilities so that the external users can test our static analyzer.

The tool can be download from the public repository : https://github.com/sjmini/icse2020-Solidity

Additionally, archived versions from 23.01.2020 (release:`V2.0`) can be found at: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3625258.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3625258)

The details on how to execute the static analyzer can be found at INSTALL.md
