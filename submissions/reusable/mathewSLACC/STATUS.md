We are applying for the **Reusable** badge at ICSE'20 artifact track. We believe our submission deserves the badge due to the following reasons
* The source code for our tool SLACC is publically available on [Github](https://github.com/DynamicCodeSearch/SLACC/tree/ICSE20). 
* We have documented the setup for the tool in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/DynamicCodeSearch/SLACC/blob/ICSE20/INSTALL.md) and provided a preconfigured virtualbox image where SLACC can be run on new and existing datasets.
* We have created a detailed workflow to extract clones from the example used in the `Motivation` section of the [paper](https://github.com/DynamicCodeSearch/SLACC/blob/ICSE20/SLACC_preprint.pdf).
* We have provided the data used in this study in our paper publically in the github repository. The experiment can be repeated on the virtualbox image using the steps described in [README.md](https://github.com/DynamicCodeSearch/SLACC/blob/ICSE20/README.md).
