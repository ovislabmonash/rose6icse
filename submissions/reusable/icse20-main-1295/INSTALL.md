The VM we provide should have everything you need already installed.

To test that everything is setup as expected, try working through the
instructions for one of the case studies (table 2 in the paper), which
you can find in
`~/icse2020-verifying-object-construction-aec/case-studies/case-studies.md`
on the VM.
