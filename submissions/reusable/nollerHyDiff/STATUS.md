# [Available] and [Reusable]

## Reasons for [Available]
All evaluation artifacts including the subjects, the results and the tool are made available online via our GitHub page.
This page is public and we created a DOI for our release by archiving the repository with Zenodo.
Furthermore, we provide a Docker image with the pre-built tool and evaluation subjects.

## Reasons for [Reusable]
Our tool and all evaluation subjects are published (GitHub, Zenodo, and Docker).
Other researchers or practitioners can easily replay our evaluation with the provided scripts.
Furthermore, they can adapt these scrips to run their own analysis.
