# STATUS

We are applying the Reusable badge for the following reason:

1. We made our tool available on GitHub: [CRExperiment](https://github.com/ishepard/CRExperiment)
2. The tool is well-documented, with clear instructions on how to run it, install it, and even extend it
3. We made the replication package of the paper available on Zenodo
4. The replication package contains a modified version of CRExperiment, as well as the instructions on how to analyze the results and reproduce the results of the paper
