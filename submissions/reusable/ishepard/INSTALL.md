# INSTALL

### Online experiment tool

To run the customized version of [CRExperiment](https://github.com/ishepard/CRExperiment) that we used in the paper, we created a `README.md` inside the `experiment-tool/` directory. Please follow the instructions to run the online experiment. You need Python3 installed.

### Analysis of the results

If you want to parse the logs of our users and reproduce the results of the paper instead, the only requirements are:

1. Python3
2. R (and RStudio). See [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org) for more information. (We run the scripts using R ver. 3.5.2)

Once you have installed both, you can reproduce the results of paper. Please refere to `README.md` for this.
