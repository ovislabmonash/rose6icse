## Applying for the Available Badge
We are applying for the Available badge for the following reasons:

* Our entire data analysis is available in Docker containers publicly accessible on the Docker Hub archival repository.

* We carefully documented and structured our analysis files to increase comprehensibility.

* The README with detailed instructions on how to execute and reuse our artifact is also publicly available in a GitHub repository (soon to be archived by Zenodo - their service was down at the time of submission).

* We made it very easy to reproduce our results by just having to run a single R file and 4 well-documented interactive Jupyter notebooks inside Docker containers (no need to install any dependencies besides Docker).
