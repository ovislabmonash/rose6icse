We are applying for the `Reusable and Available` badge. 

First, we released our source code and artefacts so that they are `available` for other researchers.

Second, our automated parameter optimisation tool can be `reused` for further testing and development. We describe the workflow and usages of the tool step by step.

We envisage that this tool can be used by others and make contributions to the software engineering community.
