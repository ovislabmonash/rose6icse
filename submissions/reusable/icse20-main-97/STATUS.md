# Apply for the Reusable and Available Badges

#### We are applying for the Reusable and Available badges for the following reasons.

* Our tool is open-sourced, available via [Github](https://github.com/sheisc/BARRA).
* Our tool is carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that its reuse and repurposing are facilitated. 
* Our tool is reusable as it can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/sheisc/BARRA) and  rebuilt from scratch via a shell script (R4/build.sh). 
* In particular, a virtual machine image [Ubuntu16.04.vmx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MnK8p9TcZIYDOr9hZKJOoL50cldv0J7W/view?usp=sharing) is also provided for fast evaluation.
