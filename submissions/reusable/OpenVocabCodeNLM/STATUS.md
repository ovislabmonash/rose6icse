We apply for AVAILABLE and REUSABLE badges.

All our artifacts are publicly available and are assigned a DOI. One of the libraries is available as a package on PyPI (The Python Package Index), the other is available for installation from GitHub.

The libraries are documented and contain examples of usage. The pre-trained models are properly named and can be easily reused.
